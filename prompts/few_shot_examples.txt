=== Key Patterns ===
1. Always check Android state first (has_edittext, current_screen)
2. Use target="title" or target="body" for note fields
3. Use focus action to switch between title and body
4. Tap coordinates can be (0,0) - executor will find element via UIAutomator
5. After typing vault name, immediately tap "Create vault" button
6. For storage selection, always choose "App storage" not "Device storage"
