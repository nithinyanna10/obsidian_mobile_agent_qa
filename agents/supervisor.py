Test Case: "{test_text}"

Look at the screenshot and determine if the test PASSED or FAILED.

Rules:
1. Check if the test goal is visually achieved in the screenshot
2. For tests that should PASS: verify the expected outcome is visible (e.g., vault created, note created)
3. For tests that should FAIL: verify the expected failure is visible (e.g., element not found, assertion mismatch)
4. If the required element is NOT visible → FAIL
5. If assertion doesn't match (e.g., color is not red) → FAIL

**SPECIFIC TEST 1 RULES (Vault Creation):**
- **CRITICAL**: If you see "Create note" or "New note" or "Create new note" button visible → Test 1 MUST PASS (vault is created and entered)
- If you see "files in internvault" or vault name "InternVault" visible → Test 1 PASSED
- **IMPORTANT**: The presence of "create new note" button is PROOF that the vault was created and entered successfully
- You do NOT need to see the exact text "InternVault" if "create new note" button is visible - that button only appears when inside a vault
- If "create new note" button is visible, return PASS immediately - do not look for vault name

**SPECIFIC TEST 2 RULES (Note Creation):**
- If you see note title "Meeting Notes" (or "Meeting Note" if truncated) AND body text "Daily Standup" → Test 2 PASSED
- If you see "Meeting Notes" or "Meeting Note" in the note editor with "Daily Standup" text visible → Test 2 PASSED
- The title and body do NOT need to be on separate lines - they can be concatenated (e.g., "Meeting NoteDaily Standup")
- As long as "Daily Standup" is visible and "Meeting Note(s)" appears anywhere in the note → Test 2 PASSED
- Do NOT require line breaks - accept the note if both texts are present

**SPECIFIC TEST 4 RULES (Appearance Accent Color):**
- **CRITICAL**: This test expects the accent color in Appearance settings to be RED
- Test 4 has should_pass=False, meaning we EXPECT the test to FAIL (accent color should NOT be Red)
- **VERIFICATION LOGIC**:
  - Look for the accent color setting/option in the Appearance screen
  - Check what color is currently selected as the accent color
  - If the accent color IS RED → The verification PASSES (accent color is Red) → But should_pass=False means we expect failure → Test result mismatch → Return FAIL
  - If the accent color is NOT RED (Purple/Blue/Green/default/monochrome/any other color) → The verification FAILS (accent color is not Red) → Return FAIL (the test failed as expected)
- Look for accent color settings/options in the Appearance screen (after tapping Appearance tab in Settings)
- Check the currently selected accent color - it should be visible in the Appearance settings screen
- Common accent color options: Red, Blue, Green, Purple, Orange, etc.
- **IMPORTANT**: If the accent color is NOT Red (Purple, Blue, Green, etc.) → Return FAIL (the test failed because accent color is not Red)
- If the accent color IS Red → Return FAIL (because should_pass=False means we expect failure, but if it's Red, the verification passed, so test fails)
- If you cannot see the accent color setting or cannot determine the selected color → FAIL
- **SUMMARY**: The test expects accent color to be Red. If accent color IS Red → verification passes but should_pass=False → Return FAIL. If accent color is NOT Red (Purple/Blue/etc.) → verification fails → Return FAIL.

**SPECIFIC TEST 3 RULES (Print to PDF):**
- **CRITICAL**: This test expects to find "Print to PDF" button in the main file menu
- Test 3 has should_pass=False, meaning we EXPECT the test to FAIL (button should NOT be found)
- **NOTE**: This test runs after Test 2, so we're already in Meeting Notes page (with "Daily Standup" visible)
- **VERIFICATION LOGIC**:
  - Look for "Print to PDF" or "Export to PDF" button in the menu (after tapping three dots/menu button)
  - The button should be in the Meeting Notes page menu (where "Daily Standup" is visible)
  - If the "Print to PDF" button IS FOUND → The verification PASSES (button found) → But should_pass=False means we expect failure → Test result mismatch → Return FAIL
  - If the "Print to PDF" button is NOT FOUND → The verification FAILS (button not found) → Return FAIL (the test failed as expected)
- Look for "Print to PDF", "Export to PDF", or similar text in the menu
- The menu should be opened from the Meeting Notes page (with "Daily Standup" visible)
- If the button is NOT found → Return FAIL (the test failed because button is not in menu)
- If the button IS found → Return FAIL (because should_pass=False means we expect failure, but if it's found, the verification passed, so test fails)
- If you cannot see the menu or cannot determine if button exists → FAIL
- **SUMMARY**: The test expects "Print to PDF" button to be in menu. If button IS found → verification passes but should_pass=False → Return FAIL. If button is NOT found → verification fails → Return FAIL.

Output format (JSON):
{{
    "verdict": "PASS" or "FAIL",
    "reason": "Brief explanation based on what you see in the screenshot",
    "details": "More detailed analysis"
}}
